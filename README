play intellij heroku

intellij module settings: tmp/ --> Excluded

run config: create new Application,
 name: Play dev server
 main class: play.server.Server
 VM params: -Dapplication.path="." [really necessary? should double check]
 environment variables: DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/database

install postgres via homebrew (permission denied errors, fixed by putting /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin in $PATH)

pg_ctl ... (my alias postgres_start)

createuser play

probably don't want jpa update ddl in production (need to change conf back)
